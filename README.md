Girls Carousel
=============

The Fred's roundabout.js is great. http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout. the js only is about 1200 lines of code. Bless me!. Have no gut to do anything about it, neither write a new one. So b it. my college bought me a 7-11 coffee -think it costs 1 buck- asking to do something for him, here it is.

#idea
It is a carousel slide show but with the pic searched from GG "girl model png". They are all Alpha png. 
I run the free application "image tuner" to batch resize them to 320x480.
I put in the background pic from Vevianart. renamed it to bg.jpg. You can replace it with anything u want anyway.

#Usage
There r 9 pics of girl. you just change them in index.html to anything u like.
The Css3 file is with the ribbon effects for H1 and H2. Note that h2 has 2 classed left and right. Each odd pic goes with h2.left and so on with the even pic with h2.right.

#Note
that Fred roundabout.js is great, no doubt ab it. Just that it is too complicate -perhaps overdone- for someone can use it but himself? not many examples or demo out there. This is one of the longest time for me to do a demo -4 hours- bc I am lost with the codes -admit his coding skill is obviously outpassed mine, so I barely understand-. 

So pls play with the index file, add/remove the li, description or so.

#Bugs?
none, but there is not much I can find useful from this work. it costs a 7-11 coffee, probalby that is it.
