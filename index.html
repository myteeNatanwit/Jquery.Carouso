The Fred's roundabout.js is great. <a href="http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout">http://fredhq.com/projects/roundabout</a>. the js only is about 1200 lines of code. Bless me!. Have no gut to do anything about it, neither write a new one. So b it. my college bought me a 7-11 coffee -think it costs 1 buck- asking to do something for him, here it is.</p>

<h1>
<a name="idea" class="anchor" href="#idea"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>idea</h1>

<p>It is a carousel slide show but with the pic searched from GG "girl model png". They are all Alpha png. 
I run the free application "image tuner" to batch resize them to 320x480.
I put in the background pic from deviantart. renamed it to bg.jpg. You can replace it with anything u want anyway.</p>

<h1>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<p>There r 9 pics of girl. you just change them in index.html to anything u like.
The Css3 file is with the ribbon effects for H1 and H2. Note that h2 has 2 classed left and right. Each odd pic goes with h2.left and so on with the even pic with h2.right.
The names in there r just those came to my mind at that time. Not in any particular order or selection. They are all fictional.</p>

<h1>
<a name="note" class="anchor" href="#note"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Note</h1>

<p>that Fred roundabout.js is great, no doubt ab it. Just that it is too complicate with over thousand LOC -perhaps overdone- for someone can use without significant performance trade. not many examples or demo out there. This is one of the longest time for me to do a demo -4 hours- bc I am lost with the codes -admit his coding skill is obviously outpassed mine, so I barely understand-. </p>

<p>So pls play with the index file, add/remove the li, description or so. Have a gut to play with the Js file? suit yrself.</p>

<h1>
<a name="bugs" class="anchor" href="#bugs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bugs?</h1>

<p>none, but there is not much I can find useful from this work. it costs a 7-11 coffee, probably that is it.</p>
