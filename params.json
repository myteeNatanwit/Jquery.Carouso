Bless me!. Have no gut to do anything about it, neither write a new one. So b it. my college bought me a 7-11 coffee -think it costs 1 buck- asking to do something for him, here it is.\r\n\r\n#idea\r\nIt is a carousel slide show but with the pic searched from GG \"girl model png\". They are all Alpha png. \r\nI run the free application \"image tuner\" to batch resize them to 320x480.\r\nI put in the background pic from deviantart. renamed it to bg.jpg. You can replace it with anything u want anyway.\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\nThere r 9 pics of girl. you just change them in index.html to anything u like.\r\nThe Css3 file is with the ribbon effects for H1 and H2. Note that h2 has 2 classed left and right. Each odd pic goes with h2.left and so on with the even pic with h2.right.\r\nThe names in there r just those came to my mind at that time. Not in any particular order or selection. They are all fictional.\r\n\r\n#Note\r\nthat Fred roundabout.js is great, no doubt ab it. Just that it is too complicate with over thousand LOC -perhaps overdone- for someone can use without significant performance trade. not many examples or demo out there. This is one of the longest time for me to do a demo -4 hours- bc I am lost with the codes -admit his coding skill is obviously outpassed mine, so I barely understand-. \r\n\r\nSo pls play with the index file, add/remove the li, description or so. Have a gut to play with the Js file? suit yrself.\r\n\r\n#Bugs?\r\nnone, but there is not much I can find useful from this work. it costs a 7-11 coffee, probably that is it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
